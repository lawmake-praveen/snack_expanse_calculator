# Snack Calculator App

# In this project that I created using flutter I used shared preferences to store and retrive data about the snacks and history.

</p>
In the home page first you need to create your snack using the add button in the appBar. you have to create only one time. The next time you enter the app the data will be coming from the local device because I used shared Preferences to store the data.

</p>
The Home page lists all the created snacks with its price and the quantity. 
You can increase and decrease the quantity based on your preferences.
the quantity also get saved in the device.

when you complete the snacks if you want to save the total amount you can save using the save button and it will save with time and date.
